# svelte-kit-file-upload-reader

Full example with a simple form, the script (client side), and the upload (server side).

The project uses these packages:  
[adapter-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sveltejs/adapter-node), [base64-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base64-js) and [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra).

There isn't a lot of CSS and form design here. Not very fun but it works!

## Run the server in preview / production mode.

With npm: `npm run build`, then `npm run preview`
